# Spring Boot Best practices Kit
This project serves as a foundational template for building well-structured and efficient backend applications. It's designed for practice purposes to showcase essential backend development principles you can leverage when starting new projects. By referring to this codebase, you can ensure consistent best practices, a clean structure, and a solid starting point for your development endeavors.

## Features

- **Organized Project Structure**: Maintain a clean and scalable folder hierarchy for effortless project navigation and management.
- **Robust HTTP Handling**: Implement proper handling of HTTP requests, responses, and status codes to ensure appropriate communication with clients.
- **Data Validation & Integrity**: Enforce data validation to guarantee the accuracy and consistency of information within your application.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Establish robust exception handling mechanisms to gracefully manage errors, prevent application crashes, and provide meaningful feedback to users.
- **Logging for Enhanced Debugging & Monitoring**: Leverage logging to record application events, simplify debugging processes, and gain valuable insights for monitoring purposes.
- **Effective Database Transactions**: Manage database transactions effectively to ensure data consistency and maintain transactional integrity.
- **Detailed API Documentation with Swagger**: Generate thorough API documentation using Swagger to enhance developer experience and facilitate API testing.
- **Efficient Pagination**: Implement pagination to handle large datasets effectively and deliver results in manageable chunks.
- **Thorough Testing**: Ensure code reliability and functionality with unit tests and integration tests powered by JUnit and Mockito.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: A powerful framework for rapidly creating production-grade backend applications.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies data access by providing a layer of abstraction between your application and the underlying database.
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust and open-source object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) used for data persistence.
- **Lombok**: Enhances developer productivity by reducing boilerplate code for getters, setters, and other common Java functionalities.
- **SLF4J**: Provides a simple logging facade, allowing flexibility in choosing a specific logging implementation.
- **JUnit**: A popular unit testing framework for verifying the correctness of individual units of code.
- **Mockito**: A mocking framework that enables the creation of mock objects for testing purposes, simulating real-world dependencies.
- **Swagger**: An open-source framework for generating comprehensive API documentation and facilitating API testing.
